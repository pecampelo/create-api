# create-api

This is a lightweight boilerplate for creating APIs. It does not require any npm libraries except for the in-built Node modules, so it usually requires some handiwork and a trial-and-error process, but this compensates for its speed and minimalism.

## Setup

## Features
- JSON output
- Custom Headers that removed some possibly vulnerable headers

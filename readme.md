# create-api

This is a lightweight boilerplate for creating APIs. It does not require any npm libraries except for the in-built Node modules, so it usually requires some handiwork and a trial-and-error process, but this compensates for its speed and minimalism.

## Setup

- npm i create-node-api-generator

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-node-api-generator

## Features
- JSON output
- Custom Headers that removed some possibly vulnerable headers
- Separate reusable models that handle messaging and defaulting data
- Custom Route Handler.
